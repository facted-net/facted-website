								<p>The Proven system allows independent verification of exactly when a photograph was taken: down to the second, with multiple methods of verification, and the ability for third parties to introduce their own more sophisticated verification methods such as proving the location or contents of the photograph.</p>

								<p>Example: A journalist takes a picture of a police officer firing a gun at an unarmed man at a protest. The file contains a unique number broadcast globally and recorded publicly, which proves that it was taken no earlier. The file is uploaded to a distributed, censorship-resistant file sharing service, and its signature is recorded in a public ledger, which proves that it was taken no later.  The journalist can now prove when the image was taken. An editor, reader, prosecutor or judge can independently verify the provenance of this image, which can serve as high quality evidence that is resistant to censorship and manipulation.</p>
